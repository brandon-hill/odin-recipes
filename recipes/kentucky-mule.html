  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The Moscow Mule is one of the most popular cocktails in the United States. The refreshing, effervescent combination of vodka, lime and ginger beer can quench even the biggest thirsts. The Moscow Mule is certainly the best known cocktail of its kind, but the mule itself is actually a drink category characterized by its use of ginger beer. So, there’s more than one way to mule. The Kentucky Mule proves that. It simply subs bourbon for vodka, hence the “Kentucky” moniker. The bourbon cuts through the ginger more aggressively than vodka, resulting in a more flavorful drink than the original. For the best results, try using a high-quality, spicy ginger beer that will stand up to the whiskey. Or, if you’d like to experiment, you can try your hand at making your own ginger syrup. In that case, use club soda as your bubbly topper. The Kentucky Mule is exceedingly easy to make. Simply combine your ingredients with plenty of ice in a copper mug, if you have one. Otherwise, a highball glass will do. Garnish with mint, and you have an American twist on the classic that you’ll want to drink all year long.</p>
